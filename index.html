        <p>
            Wikipedia is an amazing website that had an encyclopedic entry for nearly anything you can think of. <br>
            Its content is user-generated, but every new page and edit is checked by a "Chief Editor" <br>
            befor it goes public. Although not infaluable, Wikipedia pages are generaly safe from <br>
            blatantly false information and extreme biases.

            National Park

        <p>
            Yellowstone is the most incredible place on the planet. Its geothermal features are so <br>
            unique that when it was first discovered, no one believed it was real. Even the newspapers <br>
            refused to report about a land of "Rainbow lakes, boiling mud pudles, and geysers of water <br>
            over 200 feet high" because "we don't report fiction."

            Superstars

        <p>
            I was skeptical at first, but Mario Party Superstars (Nintendo Switch, 2021) ended up being <br>
            on of the most fun party-multiplayer games I have ever played. Across 5 board and 105 minigames, <br>
            you won't run out of content for an entire play session. Plus, in addition to local multiplayer, <br>
            it also has, in a rare move from Nintendo, good online.
